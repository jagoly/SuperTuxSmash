### About SuperTuxSmash
SuperTuxSmash, or STS, is a WIP open source fighting game, in the style of Super Smash Bros from Nintendo. I hope for it to be to Smash Bros what SuperTuxKart is to Mario Kart. Like STK, it features mascots from a number of open source projects. In addition, I hope to feature characters from a few FOSS games, such as The Battle for Wesnoth, if the creators of it approve.

SuperTuxSmash requires [SQEE](https://github.com/jagoly/sqee).

### Downloads

The game is very far from complete, but you can get automatic builds for [Linux](https://nightly.link/jagoly/SuperTuxSmash/workflows/linux/master/sts-linux-debug.zip) and [Windows](https://nightly.link/jagoly/SuperTuxSmash/workflows/windows/master/sts-windows-debug.zip). These are automatically built for every commit to master. For an idea on how to build STS yourself, you can have a look at [linux.yml](https://github.com/jagoly/SuperTuxSmash/blob/master/.github/workflows/linux.yml) and [windows.yml](https://github.com/jagoly/SuperTuxSmash/blob/master/.github/workflows/windows.yml).

### Contributing

SuperTuxSmash needs your help! More than anything else, right now the project needs modelers and animators. Currently, the only usable character is Mario, whose assets are taken from Brawl. Obviously, we would like to remove these as soon as possible.

Any other contributions are also extremely welcome: code, testing, ideas, moveset design, etc. Open an issue, PR, or send me an email!
