# SuperTuxSmash Readme

##### About SuperTuxSmash
SuperTuxSmash, or STS, is a WIP open source fighting game, in the style of Super Smash Bros from Nintendo. I hope for it to be to Smash Bros what SuperTuxKart is to Mario Kart. Like STK, it features mascots from a number of open source projects. In addition, I hope to feature characters from a few FOSS games, such as The Battle for Wesnoth, if the creators of it approve.
