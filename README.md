##### About SuperTuxSmash
SuperTuxSmash, or STS, is a WIP open source fighting game, in the style of Super Smash Bros from Nintendo. I hope for it to be to Smash Bros what SuperTuxKart is to Mario Kart. Like STK, it features mascots from a number of open source projects. In addition, I hope to feature characters from a few FOSS games, such as The Battle for Wesnoth, if the creators of it approve.

SuperTuxSmash requires [SQEE](https://github.com/jagoly/sqee).

##### Downloads

The game is very far from complete, but you can get automatic builds for 64bit Windows from [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jagoly/supertuxsmash/build/artifacts). No Linux builds are currently available, but STS is fairly easy to build yourself (check out [.travis.yml](https://github.com/jagoly/SuperTuxSmash/blob/travis/.travis.yml)).
